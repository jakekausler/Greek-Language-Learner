REMEMBER:
When looking for matches, look at the head of the nodes. For example, S-V-O in Mat1:2:1-1:6:7 has Ἀβραὰμ - Name S-V-O(this,Birthing,Person). Birthing gets γεννάω, but Person gets Ἰσαάκ, not ὁ.
When more than one category can fit, split them with '/':
	Person/Place
[Category] is a placeholder referring to another structure in the tree (and all its children)
